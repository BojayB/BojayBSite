Just the website that I've made. Take whatever you want from it.
The css can be found at https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura/blob/master/css/sakura-vader.css. 
Copy the raw data from their css, make a file called ```sakura-vader.css```, paste the raw data you've copied into it, and save it in the root of the web files.
