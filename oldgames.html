<img src="Images/100%orangejuice.png" alt="100%orangejuice.png">
</a>
<p>Anime mario party with cards. Pretty good.
Wasted time in coding class, great when bored.</p>

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/57300/Amnesia_The_Dark_Descent/" target="_blank">
<h4>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</h4>
<img src="Images/darkdescent.png" alt="darkdescent.png">
</a>
<p>Horrifying. I love replaying this game with various input methods. The "Grab everything" mechanic is something I enjoy very much. Would definitely tell you to purchase this game at full price, would flip if it was on sale.</p>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239200/Amnesia_A_Machine_for_Pigs/" target="_blank">
<h4>Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs</h4>
<img src="Images/machineforpigs.png" alt="machineforpigs.png">
</a>
<p>Scarier than the Dark Descent in my book. I beat Dark Descent before I played A Machine For Pigs and I couldn't make it past the beginning until recently because I was too scared of it. Great horror factor so far I suppse, with the pigs and all. Of all things in something scary like a movie or video game, I fucking hate pigs the most. Probably due to watching saw as a younger fellow.</p>

<h4>Battleblock Theater</h4>
<img src="Images/battleblocktheater.png" alt="battleblocktheater.png">
<p>I used to play this game all the time with a pal of mine when i was a wee lad. Pretty great, made by mr Tom Fulp and friends, voiced by Stamper, great game. Don't play it often anymore, kinda boring now. Would still recommend.</p>

<h4>Beginners Guide</h4>
<img src="Images/beginners guide.png" alt="beginners guide.png">
<p>Great game. Played it through a time or two and it was really good. Amazing narritive and story, pretty decent gameplay. Recommended.</p>

<h4>Black Mesa</h4>
<img src="Images/blackessa.png" alt="blackessa.png">
<p>It's a remake of Half-Life and I fucking love it. Definitely recommend this game.</p>

<h4>Borderlands 2</h4>
<img src="Images/borderlands2.png" alt="borderlands2.png">
<p>Played for a few hours on a low-end pc, it was alright.</p>

<h4>Celeste</h4>
<img src="Images/celeste.png" alt="celeste.png">
<p>Yeah it's pretty good.</p>

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250340/Blockland/" target="_blank">
<h4>Blockland</h4>
<img src="Images/cockland.png" alt="cockland.png">
</a>
<p>Could be better but for what it is, it's not bad</p>

<h4>Counter Strike*s*</h4>
<img src="Images/counterstrikes.png" alt="counterstrikes.png">
<p>I enjoy Counter Strike Source the most, but they're all really the same game so they're fine.</p>
