<h1> Thank you for reading! </h1>

<p> This website is 100% WIP and nowhere NEAR finished, and probably never will be. I change certain aspects of every page every now and then 
to adjust them to my liking, and I add new pages aaaalll the time! 
</p>
<h2>  If you don't see a visible link to a page, that doesn't mean its not there! </h2>

<p> Move your mouse all over the screen slow-ish to see if you can uncover some hidden webpages! I've 
hidden links all around the index page, and I'll be sure to add more to it and other pages!
I find it fun to add pages, but some of them don't really have any meaning, so I decide to hide them around so that
they're still there, just not obvious. It's a fun little challenge and allows my webpages to continue looking semi-decent!
</p>
<hr>
<small> I'll give you a little hint on where to find one! If you hover your mouse to the right of the Games link near the top of the page,
you'll find a hidden link right there! it's a picture of my friend when he was zooming around his webcam. Some other links could be in a similar area on other pages! </small>
